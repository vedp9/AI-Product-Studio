## 🎯 Real World Problem

> **AI Talent Report, 2026** —
> AI talent demand exceeds supply 3.2:1 globally.
> 1.6M open positions, only 518K qualified candidates.
> LLM development, MLOps, and AI ethics show
> the most severe shortages.
>
> **IDC, 2026** — Skills gaps risk $5.5 trillion
> in global losses. Only a third of employees
> received any AI training in the past year.
>
> **PwC, 2025** — AI roles command a 56% wage
> premium over standard data science roles.
> Job postings requiring AI skills skyrocketed
> nearly 200-fold between 2021 and 2025.

Everyone wants to become an AI engineer.
Nobody gives them a personalized roadmap
based on where they are right now.
Generic courses ignore your background.
MentorAI fixes that.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- RAG on structured knowledge produces
  dramatically better personalization
  than stuffing everything in one prompt —
  retrieval finds what's relevant
  to THIS learner's profile
- Pydantic safe defaults are critical
  for LLM output — always provide fallbacks
  for every field
- The capstone pattern: build a tool
  that uses every technique from your
  portfolio in one project —
  RAG, structured output, agents,
  Streamlit, Pydantic, vector DB
- Don't write brittle assertions on
  LLM output values — test shape
  and type, not specific content
- The product insight: everyone wants
  a learning path but nobody wants
  a generic one — personalization
  is the product
