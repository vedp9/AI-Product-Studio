## 🎯 Real World Problem

> **Asana State of Work Innovation, 2025** —
> 60% of work time is spent on "work about work."
> Writing a thorough research brief takes
> 3–5 hours of reading, note-taking,
> cross-referencing, and synthesis.
>
> **Microsoft Work Trend Index, 2025** —
> 53% of leaders say productivity must increase
> while 80% of employees say they lack the time
> or energy to do their work.

ResearchForge compresses 3–5 hours of manual
research into under 4 minutes —
without sacrificing source verification
or structured synthesis.

## 🤖 The 4 Agents

| Agent | Job | Why Separate |
|---|---|---|
| Planner | Breaks query into 4 sub-questions | Targeted search > generic search |
| Researcher | Executes web searches via Tavily | Real-time data, not LLM memory |
| Fact Checker | Verifies and filters results | Quality gate before synthesis |
| Writer | Synthesizes verified facts into brief | Only sees clean data |

**Why 4 agents instead of 1 big prompt:**
Each agent has ONE job. Single responsibility
means each step is independently debuggable,
improvable, and replaceable.
This is "separation of concerns"
applied to AI systems.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- 4 focused agents beats 1 giant prompt
  every time — easier to debug,
  better output quality, cleaner architecture
- Dependency injection: passing `call_gemini`
  as a function reference makes agents
  independently testable
- DP optimal substructure (DSA) maps directly
  to agent task decomposition —
  break the problem into sub-problems,
  solve each, combine results
- The Fact Checker is the most valuable agent —
  without it the Writer hallucinates
  from noisy search results
- Manual state machine > framework overhead
  for learning and for interviews
