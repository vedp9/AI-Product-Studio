## 🎯 Real World Problem

> **Atlassian State of Teams Report, 2023** — knowledge workers 
> spend 31 hours per month in unproductive meetings.
>
> **Microsoft Work Trend Index, April 2024** — 64% of workers 
> say they don't have enough time for focused work because of meetings.
>
> **Atlassian, 2023** — 47% of employees leave meetings unsure 
> of what they're supposed to do next.

Microsoft Teams and Google Meet solve the **recording problem.**
MeetingMind solves the **follow-through problem** — structured 
extraction of decisions, owners, and follow-ups from any audio source.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Multi-step pipelines: each step independent and testable
- faster-whisper runs fully locally — no API cost, no data privacy risk
- Sliding window pattern in audio chunking mirrors DSA concepts
- Pydantic nested models (ActionItem inside MeetingBrief)
- Handling real-world audio edge cases
