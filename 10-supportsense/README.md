## 🎯 Real World Problem

> **Gartner, 2026** — 98% of customer service
> leaders say smooth AI-to-human transitions
> are essential. 90% admit they struggle
> with handoffs. Getting escalation right
> matters more than the AI itself.
>
> **AI Customer Service Market, 2026** —
> $15.12 billion market. Companies see
> $3.50 return for every $1 invested.
> Klarna's AI handled 2/3 of all support
> conversations — equivalent to 700 agents.
>
> **Cost per interaction dropped 68%** —
> from $4.60 to $1.45 after AI implementation.
> (2025 industry benchmarks)

The problem isn't building a chatbot.
Every company has a chatbot.
The problem is knowing when NOT to answer —
and handing off with full context
when escalation is needed.
That's what SupportSense solves.

Customer Query

Input Validation

RAG Retrieval (ChromaDB + sentence-transformers)
↓
Intent Classifier
→ Keyword pre-check (fast, deterministic)
→ LLM classification (nuanced)

│   ANSWERABLE    │     ESCALATE         │
│                 │                      │
│ Generate answer │ Create ticket        │

│                 │ department,          │

## 🧠 What I Learned

- The escalation logic is more valuable
  than the answer logic —
  knowing when NOT to answer is the
  senior engineering insight
- Two-step intent classification:
  keyword check first (no API cost),
  LLM second (nuanced cases only)
- Confidence threshold routing —
  LOW confidence answers auto-escalate
  rather than risk giving wrong info
- RAG without source citation = guessing.
  RAG with source citation = trust.
- Pydantic's Optional fields let
  one model handle both answer
  and escalation responses cleanly
