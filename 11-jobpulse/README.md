## 🎯 Real World Problem

> **Upplai Research, March 2026** —
> Indeed response rates: 20–25%.
> LinkedIn: 3–13%.
> Referrals: 8x more likely to get hired.
> Most job seekers never track which
> channel actually works for them.
>
> **Ashby Recruiting Benchmarks, 2025** —
> Average job posting receives 340 applicants,
> a 182% increase from 2021.
> Only 2% of applicants reach interview stage.
> It takes 42 applications on average
> to land one interview.
>
> **Pathrise Analysis, 2025** —
> Average tech job seeker needed 294
> applications to land one offer.

Most job seekers apply blindly.
No tracking. No pattern recognition.
No data on what's working.
JobPulse turns your spreadsheet into
a strategic coaching session.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Pandas groupby + value_counts is all
  you need for 80% of data analysis —
  no need for complex ML pipelines
- Plotly funnel charts are built for
  exactly this use case — one line of code
- LLMs are better at insight synthesis
  than threshold rules — "referral rate
  is high but volume is low, so prioritize
  networking" requires reasoning
- Graph traversal (DSA) maps directly
  to funnel analysis — tracking nodes
  and transitions between stages
- The "eat your own dog food" principle:
  I used JobPulse on my own job search
  data while building it
