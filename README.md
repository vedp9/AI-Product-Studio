## Project Details

---

### 01 — ResumeLens AI

**What it does:** Scores a resume against a job description and returns structured fit analysis with gap identification.

**Key technique:** Prompt engineering with Pydantic-validated JSON output. The system prompt specifies exact JSON schema — the LLM fills it, Pydantic validates it.

**What I learned:** Escaping `{{}}` in Python `.format()` strings when the prompt itself contains JSON template syntax.

**Stack:** `Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

```bash
cd 01-resumelens-ai && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 02 — MeetingMind

**What it does:** Uploads an audio recording of a meeting and returns a structured brief — summary, action items, decisions, follow-ups.

**Key technique:** Local speech-to-text with faster-whisper (Systran), then structured extraction with Gemini. Audio never leaves the machine.

**What I learned:** faster-whisper model weights download from HuggingFace Hub on first run. The unauthenticated download warning is harmless.

**Stack:** `faster-whisper · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Streamlit · Pydantic`

```bash
cd 02-meetingmind && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 03 — ClauseGuard

**What it does:** Uploads a legal contract PDF and scans every clause for risk — flagging severity, explanation, and recommended action.

**Key technique:** Paragraph-level RAG chunking (beats token chunking for legal docs). Each clause embedded separately, retrieved by semantic similarity to risk-pattern queries.

**What I learned:** Paragraph chunking preserves legal clause context far better than fixed-size token chunks. The chunk boundary IS the clause boundary.

**Stack:** `PyMuPDF · sentence-transformers · ChromaDB · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

> ⚠️ Not legal advice. For educational demonstration only.

```bash
cd 03-clauseguard && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 04 — PitchBot

**What it does:** Takes a prospect's LinkedIn profile text and generates 3 personalized cold email variants — short, medium, and detailed.

**Key technique:** 3-step prompt chain. Step 1 extracts profile signals. Step 2 maps signals to value props. Step 3 writes the email. Each step builds on the previous.

**What I learned:** LinkedIn scraping is blocked — paste-the-profile-text approach is faster and more reliable than scraping. Chaining prompts beats one large prompt for quality.

**Stack:** `requests · BeautifulSoup · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Streamlit · Pydantic`

```bash
cd 04-pitchbot && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 05 — BrainBase

**What it does:** Upload multiple documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and ask questions across all of them — with source citations per answer.

**Key technique:** Multi-format RAG with paragraph + 50-word overlap chunking. Overlap prevents context loss at chunk boundaries. Source citation is enforced at the prompt level.

**What I learned:** Overlap chunking is critical — without it, answers that span two chunks get cut off mid-reasoning.

**Stack:** `PyMuPDF · python-docx · sentence-transformers · ChromaDB · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Streamlit`

```bash
cd 05-brainbase && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 06 — CompeteAI

**What it does:** Enter your company and up to 3 competitors — an AI agent searches the web in real-time and generates a structured competitive intelligence brief in under 90 seconds.

**Key technique:** ReAct agent pattern. Step 1: Gemini plans 8 strategic search queries. Step 2: Tavily executes searches. Step 3: Filter noise. Step 4: Gemini synthesizes brief.

**What I learned:** The planning step matters more than the execution step. A well-designed query plan beats fast search execution every time.

**Stack:** `Tavily Search API · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

**Extra API needed:** `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env`

```bash
cd 06-competeai && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 07 — SymptomSense

**What it does:** Describes symptoms → returns triage level (ER / See Doctor / Monitor at Home) with reasoning, red flags, and immediate steps. Never diagnoses.

**Key technique:** 7-layer safety architecture. Emergency detection runs **before** the API call using deterministic keyword matching — rule-based systems cannot hallucinate.

**Safety layers:**
1. Pydantic input validation
2. Rule-based red flag pre-check (no API call)
3. Constrained system prompt (positive + negative)
4. API failure fallback (escalates, never downgrades)
5. JSON parse failure handler
6. Medication keyword stripper (post-LLM)
7. Pydantic output validation + disclaimer enforcement

**What I learned:** For life-critical detection, deterministic always beats probabilistic. The most important safety layer is the one that runs before the LLM.

**Stack:** `Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

> See [`07-symptomsense/SAFETY_DESIGN.md`](07-symptomsense/SAFETY_DESIGN.md) for full safety documentation.

```bash
cd 07-symptomsense && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 08 — PRReview AI

**What it does:** Paste a GitHub PR URL → get a full AI code review with bugs, security issues, performance problems, style feedback, and a ready-to-paste GitHub review comment.

**Key technique:** Map-reduce pattern. Map: each changed file reviewed independently by Gemini. Reduce: all file reviews synthesized into one PR-level verdict + suggested comment.

**What I learned:** Diff parsing is messier than expected. Binary files, lock files, truncation — all need explicit handling before the LLM ever sees the code.

**Stack:** `PyGitHub · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

**Extra API needed:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env` (needs `repo` scope)

```bash
cd 08-prreview-ai && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 09 — ResearchForge

**What it does:** Enter any research question → 4 specialized AI agents plan, search, verify, and synthesize a full research brief in under 4 minutes.

**Agent pipeline:**
- **Planner** — breaks query into 4 targeted sub-questions
- **Researcher** — executes web searches via Tavily
- **Fact Checker** — verifies, scores confidence, detects contradictions
- **Writer** — synthesizes verified facts into structured report

**Key technique:** Manual state machine (no LangGraph). Shared state dict passed between agents. Dependency injection — `call_gemini` passed as function reference for testability.

**What I learned:** The Fact Checker is the most valuable agent. Without it, the Writer synthesizes garbage from noisy web results. Quality gate before synthesis — not after.

**Stack:** `Tavily Search API · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit · Python`

**Extra API needed:** `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env`

```bash
cd 09-researchforge && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 10 — SupportSense

**What it does:** AI customer support agent for a demo SaaS product (FlowDesk). Answers from KB instantly — escalates to humans with a structured ticket when needed.

**Key technique:** Two-step intent classification. Step 1: keyword pre-check (no API call) — handles 60% of cases instantly. Step 2: LLM classification for nuanced cases. RAG retrieval on 10-document knowledge base with confidence gating.

**Escalation ticket includes:** priority, department routing, customer sentiment, suggested resolution, full context for the human agent.

**What I learned:** The escalation logic is more valuable than the answer logic. Knowing when NOT to answer is the senior engineering insight.

**Stack:** `sentence-transformers · ChromaDB · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

```bash
cd 10-supportsense && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 11 — JobPulse

**What it does:** Upload your job application CSV → get AI-powered insights on response rates, funnel drop-off, source performance, and a personalized weekly action plan.

**Metrics calculated:**
- Response rate by source (LinkedIn vs Referral vs Direct)
- Application funnel (Applied → Phone → Technical → Final → Offer)
- Ghost rate, interview rate, offer rate
- Benchmark vs industry averages

**What I learned:** Referral response rate is typically 3-5x higher than LinkedIn cold applications. The data makes this visible. Most job seekers never measure it.

**Stack:** `Pandas · Plotly · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

```bash
cd 11-jobpulse && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 12 — FieldReport AI

**What it does:** Speak a field report → get structured JSON data instantly. Supports 3 report types: site inspection, sales visit, delivery log.

**Key technique:** Local audio transcription with faster-whisper (runs on CPU, no cloud) → domain-specific structured extraction with Gemini. Audio never leaves the machine.

**What I learned:** Domain-specific prompts with explicit JSON schemas extract dramatically better data than generic extraction. The schema in the prompt IS the product.

**Stack:** `faster-whisper · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

```bash
cd 12-fieldreport-ai && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 13 — QueryMind

**What it does:** Ask your database a question in plain English → get the SQL query, results, and a plain-English explanation. Self-corrects on failure.

**Self-correction loop:**
```
Generate SQL → Execute → Error?
→ Send error back to Gemini with context
→ Gemini reads error and fixes query
→ Execute again (up to 2 retries)
```

**Safety layers:**
1. Prompt constraint (SELECT only)
2. First-word check (rejects non-SELECT)
3. Keyword regex scan (blocks DROP/DELETE/UPDATE/INSERT etc.)
4. Semicolon detection (prevents stacked queries)

**Demo database:** E-commerce SQLite DB with 6 tables, 500+ rows (customers, products, orders, reviews, support tickets).

**Stack:** `SQLite · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

```bash
cd 13-querymind && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

### 14 — MentorAI

**What it does:** Select your background and goal → get a personalized AI engineering curriculum with phases, projects, weekly schedule, salary milestones, and an AI mentor chat.

**Key technique:** RAG on 13 curated roadmap documents. Retrieval query built from learner profile — different backgrounds retrieve different sections. Pydantic validates every field with safe defaults for missing data.

**Output includes:** readiness score, phase-by-phase path, skills to skip, biggest gap, salary unlock, time-to-first-job estimate, portfolio project recommendations, day-by-day weekly schedule.

**Stack:** `ChromaDB · sentence-transformers · Gemini 2.0 Flash · Pydantic · Streamlit`

```bash
cd 14-mentorai && streamlit run ui.py
```

---

## 🧠 Key Patterns Across All 14 Projects

**RAG (used in Projects 3, 5, 10, 14)**
Embed documents → store in ChromaDB → embed query → retrieve top-k → send to LLM as context. The LLM answers only from retrieved content.

**Pydantic validation (used in every project)**
LLM output is unreliable. Pydantic validates every field, provides safe defaults, and prevents runtime crashes. Never trust raw LLM JSON without validation.

**Defense in depth (Projects 7, 13)**
Never rely on a single safety layer. Prompt constraints + output validation + post-processing. Each layer catches what the previous missed.

**Self-correction (Project 13)**
When a query fails, send the error back to the LLM as context. LLMs are surprisingly good at reading error messages and fixing their own output.

**Map-reduce for AI (Project 8)**
Process N items independently (map), then synthesize results (reduce). Scales better than trying to process everything in one prompt.

**Two-step classification (Project 10)**
Keyword scan first (no API cost, catches obvious cases), LLM second (handles nuanced cases). Cuts API calls by 60%.
