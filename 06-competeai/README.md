## 🎯 Real World Problem

> **Crayon Competitive Intelligence Report, 2024**
> — 77% of businesses say competitive intelligence
> is important, but only 29% do it consistently.
> The gap is time and tooling.
>
> **Global Competitive Intelligence Tools Market,
> 2024** — market valued at $0.56 billion, growing
> at 12.5% CAGR. Tools like Crayon and Kluge cost
> $500–$2000/month — out of reach for most teams.
>
> **McKinsey, 2024** — organizations with real-time
> competitor monitoring report materially shorter
> sales cycles and 33% higher prediction accuracy.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Agents fail in interesting ways — error handling
  around tool calls is more important than
  the happy path
- The planning step is more valuable than
  the execution step — a well-designed query
  plan beats a fast search every time
- BFS graph traversal in DSA maps directly
  to agent exploration — explore all angles
  at depth 1 before going deeper
- Tavily purpose-built for AI agents —
  returns clean structured results without
  HTML noise, unlike raw Google scraping
- Filtering noise before synthesis is critical
  — garbage in = garbage brief
