## 🧠 What I Learned

- RAG quality = chunking quality. Paragraph chunking
  beats token chunking for legal documents
- sentence-transformers runs 100% locally —
  zero embedding cost, zero data privacy risk
- Two-pointer pattern in DSA maps directly
  to chunk boundary detection
- Pydantic nested models for complex structured output
- Rate limit handling with exponential backoff
