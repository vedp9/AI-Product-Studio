## 🎯 Real World Problem

> **IDC Research** — the average knowledge worker
> spends 2.5 hours per day — roughly 30% of their
> workday — searching for information across
> documents, emails, and apps.
>
> **Asana State of Work Innovation, 2025** —
> 60% of work time is spent on "work about work":
> searching for information, switching between apps,
> tracking down past decisions.
>
> **McKinsey Global Institute** — a robust knowledge
> management system reduces time lost searching
> by up to 35% and boosts productivity by 20–25%.

BrainBase turns your scattered documents into a
searchable, citable knowledge base you can query
in plain English — in under 60 seconds.

## 🏗️ Architecture
```
Documents (PDF / DOCX / TXT / MD)
         ↓
Format-specific parsers (PyMuPDF / python-docx)
         ↓
Paragraph chunker (512 tokens, 50-word overlap)
         ↓
sentence-transformers (local embeddings)
         ↓
ChromaDB (local vector store)
         ↓
Question → cosine similarity retrieval
         ↓
Gemini 2.0 Flash (answer + citation)
         ↓
Pydantic validation → Streamlit UI
```

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Multi-format parsing needs format-specific
  error handling — PDFs fail differently than DOCX
- Paragraph chunking with 50-word overlap prevents
  answer loss at chunk boundaries
- Binary search in DSA maps directly to vector
  similarity search — same principle of eliminating
  half the search space at each step
- Source citation = trust. Answers without sources
  feel like guesses. Answers with quotes feel like facts
- ChromaDB's duplicate ID check prevents
  re-embedding the same document twice
