## 🎯 Real World Problem

> **Voice AI Research, 2026** —
> Production voice agent deployments grew
> 340% year-over-year. Companies using
> voice AI report 3-year ROI between
> 331% and 391% (Forrester/PolyAI).
>
> Field workers — inspectors, sales reps,
> delivery drivers — spend 30–40% of their
> time on manual data entry after completing
> fieldwork. They do the work, then type it up.
>
> **Voice recognition market: $18.39 billion
> in 2025, projected $61.71 billion by 2031.**

FieldReport AI eliminates the typing step.
Speak naturally. Get structured data.
No forms. No keyboard. No delay.

## 📋 Report Schemas

### Site Inspection
```json
{
  "location": "123 Main Street",
  "safety_rating": "FAIL",
  "overall_condition": "POOR",
  "issues": [{"severity": "CRITICAL", ...}],
  "action_items": [{"priority": "URGENT", ...}]
}
```

### Sales Visit
```json
{
  "client_name": "Acme Corp",
  "deal_stage": "Proposal",
  "sentiment": "POSITIVE",
  "next_steps": [{"action": "...", ...}]
}
```

### Delivery Log
```json
{
  "driver_name": "Mike Chen",
  "total_stops": 8,
  "completion_rate": "87%",
  "stops": [{"status": "Delivered", ...}]
}
```

## 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vedp9/AI-Product-Studio.git
cd AI-Product-Studio/labs/voice-and-document-ai/fieldreport-ai

source ../../../venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
..\..\..\venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key" > .env

streamlit run ui.py
```

First run downloads the Whisper tiny model
(~75MB). Subsequent runs are instant.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Audio processing requires temp file
  management — bytes → file → transcribe
  → cleanup. Always use try/finally.
- Whisper's VAD filter removes silence
  automatically — huge improvement
  for real-world recordings
- Domain-specific prompts extract
  dramatically better data than
  generic extraction — the schema
  in the prompt IS the product
- Queue data structure (DSA) maps directly
  to sequential audio segment processing —
  FIFO order matters for transcription
- Pydantic's default handling is critical
  for voice data — speakers often omit
  fields that forms would require
